     * I use the term middleware, but each language/framework calls the concept differently.
     * NodeJS and Rails calls it middleware. In the Java enterprise world (i.e. Java Servlet),
     * itâ€™s called filters. C# calls it delegate handlers.
     * Essentially, the middleware performs some specific function on the HTTP request or response at a specific stage in the HTTP pipeline before or after the user defined controller.
     * Middleware is a design pattern to eloquently add cross cutting concerns like logging, handling authentication, or gzip compression without having many code contact points.
     *
     * Since these cross-cutting concerns are handled in middleware, the controllers/user defined handlers can focus on the core business logic.
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * A Servlet filter is an object that can intercept HTTP requests targeted at your web application.
     *
     * When the servlet filter is loaded the first time, its init() method is called, just like with servlets.
     *
     * When a HTTP request arrives at your web application which the filter intercepts,
     * the filter can inspect the request URI, the request parameters and the request headers,
     * and based on that decide if it wants to block or forward the request to the target servlet, JSP etc.
